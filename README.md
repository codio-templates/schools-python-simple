## Welcome to Codio
It's really easy to create and run Python programs in Codio so let's get started.

In the file tree to the left, right-click on the root directory (SAMPLE-python) and choose **New File...** and name the file `main.py`.

Delete any text already in the file and add the following content:

    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    print ("Hello", name)


**The Terminal**
To run Python3 programs you will need the Terminal. Select `Tools->Terminal` from the menu at the top. Now type in to the Terminal (without the `$`):

    $ python3 main.py

This will run your program in the Terminal window. Enter your name and observe the output.

**Terminal Tips**

 - You can type "clear" into the terminal when there is too much text on screen
 - You can press the "up" arrow to cycle through old commands that you have already entered
 - You only need one Terminal open at one time
